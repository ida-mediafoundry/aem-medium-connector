         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Pitfalls of coding emails — lessons learned (part 2)</h3><p><em>Expects the reader to have a basic knowledge of coding (responsive) emails</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*o6hiCteU7wHTzKhTauIPzg.jpeg" /></figure><p>As mentioned in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/pitfalls-of-coding-emails-lessons-learned-part-1-7532803ead2c">part 1</a>, this post will include more useful tips and tricks to make sure your email looks (almost) the same across multiple mail clients.</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h4>Table cell defaults</h4><p>Default values for the align and valign attributes on a “td” are respectively “left” and “center”. You don’t have to set these attributes if the default values are the ones you need.</p><p>—</p><h4>Color issue on AOL</h4><p>I made it a custom to put all text-related styling inline on table level like the font-size, color, font-weight etc. AOL ignores the color attribute though and renders the text in default black. To get around this issue, move the color to the “td” tag.</p><pre>&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color: red&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;<br>  &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;AOL will render this in black&lt;/td&gt;<br> &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;<br>  &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;AOL will render this in red&lt;/td&gt;<br> &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</pre><p>—</p><h4>How to prevent iOS detecting date and time</h4><p>If there is any sort of date/time, phone number or address, iOS will put a blue, underlined link on it. If you don’t want iOS to detect these elements you can trick their algorithm by adding a zero width character (&amp;#8203;) in-between your string.</p><p><em>Example: June 22, 2018 becomes June&amp;#8203; 22, 2018</em></p><p>—</p><h4>Using lists</h4><p>Even if you use lists for web apps, they render differently across browsers: different bullet point weight, spacing between bullet point and text, spacing between list items themselves, … This is the same when it comes to email.</p><p>Replacing the bullet symbol with a custom one is easy to do for web applications by setting the list-style-image attribute. You can do this for your email too, but Gmail and Outlook will ignore it. So, instead of using the “ul” tag, I use tables to render a list.</p><p>Here is an example of how I build a list item:</p><pre>&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;<br>  &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;<br>   &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 8px;&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;tr&gt;<br>     &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 6px; font-size: 8px; line-height: 8px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;[url to custom bullet point]&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;5&quot; height=&quot;8&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>    &lt;/tr&gt;<br>   &lt;/table&gt;<br>  &lt;/td&gt;<br>  &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;List item text&lt;/td&gt;<br> &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</pre><p>Notice that the bullet symbol has its own wrapper table. This gives the possibility to move the image vertically. Without the table wrapper, the padding set on the image td would also affect the text td. I also recommend to set the line-height on the wrapper table at the same height of your image, otherwise it will mess up your list item height.</p><p>Another advantage to this method is that you have full control over the spacing. It looks a bit overkill, but the result is worth it!</p><p>—</p><h4>Vertically aligning a logo and text side-by-side</h4><p>The following code represents a logo with the brand name next to it:</p><pre>&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 22px; line-height: 140%;&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;<br>  &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;<br>   &lt;img src=&quot;[url to logo]&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;40&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; /&gt;<br>  &lt;/td&gt;<br>  &lt;td&gt;Brand name here&lt;/td&gt;<br> &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</pre><p>Line-height overrides vertically centered text on Outlook. You can fix this by setting the line-height at the same value as the height of the image or remove the line-height all together.</p><p>—</p><h4>Adding whitespace</h4><p>Use divs instead of wrapper tables to add whitespace between components where possible. Results in lesser HTML bloat.</p><pre>/* From */<br>&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;<br>  &lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;[content comes here]&lt;/td&gt;<br> &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</pre><pre>/* To */<br>&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px&quot;&gt;<br>[content comes here]<br>&lt;/div&gt;</pre><p>—</p><p>I am, of course, not the only one writing about this.

This way you can significantly reduce the amount of time you need to complete a task.</p><p>Which is pretty damn awesome..</p><p>Note that I’m a big fan of using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> (based on <a href="https://atom.io/">the atom editor</a>), so that will be my editor of choice for this article. But most of the plugins here can be found for any decent IDE/editor like atom, sublime, brackets, webstorm, … .</p><p>Except vim.</p><p>Because vim sucks.</p><p>And people who use vim should burn in hell 🔥😏</p><p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — -</p><h3><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify">Code Beautifier</a></h3><p>Apparently some people actually write ugly code and forget to indent their lines?</p><p>Tss…</p><p>These mere mortals disappoint me. Things like that never happen to me (nor do I ever have to do re-writes or refactors)! My code is always <strong>perfect.</strong></p><p><strong>*sarcasm*</strong></p><p>Anyway this thing is a real lifesaver. It’ll fix your css, html and javascript and make everything look pretty and indented.</p><p>What more could you want?</p><p><strong>Maybe some early opt-in bitcoins? </strong>😕</p><p>Well, too late for that!

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>5 things I learned on Retail Detail Day 2018</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*a19_MZGkjYiPI5y9tK637g.jpeg" /></figure><p>A while ago, I had the opportunity to be present at Retail Detail Day 2018 organised by Retail Detail. Retail Detail is a company that invests, creates and shares everything about retail. Additionally, they organise 8 events per year. One of these events is Retail Detail Day, with this year&#39;s subject &quot;Customer Obsessed Retail&quot;.</p><h4>Obsessed retail — some background information</h4><p>In Belgium, retail can be divided into 3 layers. The lower segment with lower-priced products is doing great. The middle segment is experiencing lots of problems due to a wide range of problems that we will not explain in too much detail here. Finally, the high segment with unique and premium products is doing great as well.</p><p>Each of these segments has their own ups and downs, opportunities and threats, and from each of these segments we can learn how retail can be booming business despite the heavy disruptions in the sector.</p><h4>1. Be different</h4><p>A lot of retailers have a webshop these days, simply because it’s the service you MUST have nowadays. However, one well-known and hugely successful retailer from the lower segment shows that a webshop may not be that important after all.</p><p><a href="https://www.action.com">Action</a> focuses on 1 brand, 1 store format and 1 store operating model. They have managed to create a very strong brand, they have become hugely successful in many countries, and they have managed to get there without investing in a webshop.</p><h4>2. Focus</h4><p>Retail Detail Day also showed that focus in retail is very important, both for your brand and for your customers. More and more, specialised and niched-down business models are proving more and more valuable.</p><p><a href="https://www.runnerslab.be/en/home">Runners’lab</a>, a company that strictly focuses on selling running shoes <em>for</em> runners <em>by</em> runners, offers a professional analysis using specialised machines for all of their customers. At the end of your visit, you walk out with running shoes completely tailored to your feet so you have less chance to get injuries.</p><p>They are very well-known in the running world thanks to this tailored experience and there are a lot more players who are discovering the power of more niched products.</p><h4>3. Stick to your DNA</h4><p>Every company in every sector will experience some rough waters. Some companies try to reinvent themselves by going in a totally different direction, creating a new identity and product portfolio. However, changing your entire business can turn on you very quickly because you lose whatever market share and reputation you could already build on.</p><p><a href="https://www.hema.be">Hema</a> is one of those retailers who shows that sticking to your identity and building on the reputation you have pays off in the long run.</p><h4>4. Data is important</h4><p>Big data is a very hot topic right now, especially among retailers. Having the right data is like having pure gold. Using data, you can adapt to your market and get to know which of your product range is selling better to which of your client segments.</p><p><a href="https://spott.tv">Spott</a>, a company using AI tools to reinvent marketing, makes it possible to buy products you can see in tv shows, movies, and advertisements. This brings yet another dimension to online shopping by allowing customers to buy the clothes from their favorite characters directly from retailers without having to do dozens of Google searches to find out exactly which clothes those characters were wearing.</p><h4>5. Disruption</h4><p>It&#39;s a must to keep changing! Being a big retailer now doesn’t mean you will be a big retailer 5 years from now. Disruptive players like Amazon, Bol.com, and Zalando have more than proven that point. One of the keys to protect yourself from larger or more disruptive players is to team up with others by working with influencers, radio, creating events, … Be visible and work with key partners to expand your reach beyond your own small(er) circle.</p><p>Also, keep reinventing your company and invest in hot topics. One of the topics that came up a few times during Retail Detail Day was investing in durability and ecology which seems to be something most retailers are currently working on.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Bringing everything together, we have learned that we need to be consistent by sticking to our DNA — even when that makes us stand out from the rest — and adopting change that fits that DNA, we can benefit from a niched product range, and we can use big data to create more advanced marketing campaigns to target more detailed market segments.</p><p>While some of these tips seem contradictory, everything starts and ends with your business DNA. Like Simon Sinek said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA">his famous TED talk</a>, it&#39;s all about why you do what you do. When you are consistent in why you do something, the core of your business remains the same while you can find new ways to adapt what and how you do business.</p><p>Days like these very much inspire and motivate me. I hope by sharing the key takeaways, it will do the same for you.</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradewinterdesign/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*XBARx0uyY64VB_q0A4YNfQ.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*PzdSSk-TdTd8582Ajb7E2g.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.lauradewinterdesign.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*-HkIcOMsCzk0jV8ujMz_Xw.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=4f912d64178" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/customer-obsessed-retail-4f912d64178">Customer Obsessed Retail</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jEbaONDFQgVHZQNXVbCihg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Nothing is more annoying than having custom pages or tools in AEM, and not being able to find them using the UI. Plus, you can&#39;t expect your users to memorize the urls either.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*zgZG6XHBERibjWcXJQBUvg.png" /></figure><p>AEM allows you to add new links to tools in the Touch UI navigation menu very easily. They could be positioned in the existing structure or you could create a new category.</p><p>These links could point to custom tools in AEM, but also to external tools like the tools you use for SEO Management, Translation, …</p><blockquote>A good AEM set-up for authors helps them navigating the CMS easily. Don’t let them find a needle in a haystack, but guide them through the interface.</blockquote><p>The best example, in my opinion, is the translator tool for dictionaries in AEM with is located on <a href="http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/i18n/translator.html">http://localhost:4502/libs/cq/i18n/translator.html</a>. Even though the tool is only available in Classic UI, there are no links to open this tool at all, neither in the Classic UI Tools nor the Touch UI navigation.</p><p>To solve this, a few nodes need to be created to define a new Touch UI Navigation item. Create the structure below with the mentioned <em>jcr:primaryType</em> properties and read the additional instructions below.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k2SOby5NwWZCbf7RFWxRhg.png" /></figure><p>The <strong>[group]</strong> node can be one of the existing groups: general, workflow, sites, assets, resources, security, commerce, cloudservices, communities, deployment or operations.</p><p>All nodes mentioned above until and including the <strong>[group]</strong> node, will be an empty node with just the jcr:primaryType set to what is mentioned in the picture above.</p><p>The <strong>[tool]</strong> node will be represented by the following configuration:</p><pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;jcr:root xmlns:jcr=&quot;http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0&quot;<br>    xmlns:nt=&quot;http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0&quot;<br>    jcr:primaryType=&quot;nt:unstructured&quot;<br>    jcr:title=&quot;Dictionaries&quot;<br>    jcr:description=&quot;Managing Dictionaries&quot;<br>    href=&quot;/libs/cq/i18n/translator.html&quot;<br>    consoleId=&quot;cq-dictionaries&quot;<br>    icon=&quot;book&quot;<br>    target=&quot;_blank&quot;<br>    order=&quot;{Long}300&quot;/&gt;</pre><p>The <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/developing/using/reference-materials/coral-ui/coralui3/Coral.Icon.html#availableIcons">Coral Icon documentation</a> lists all available icons you can mention in the icon attribute.</p><p>If you want to create your own group, the <strong>[group]</strong> node needs to contain the following properties:</p><pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;<br>&lt;jcr:root xmlns:jcr=&quot;http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0&quot;<br>    xmlns:nt=&quot;http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0&quot;<br>    jcr:primaryType=&quot;nt:unstructured&quot;<br>    jcr:title=&quot;My Own Group&quot;/&gt;</pre><p>As you can see, it’s very easy to overlay the Touch UI navigation menu and to add your own navigation items. Plus, it might be a huge help for your authors.</p><p>If you have tried to implement this using the steps above, let us know. We would love to hear how it went!</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelgeerts/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*MEy2bdTBVTxvUcNJtCdh9Q.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*GCn4hsea5PHOzgprWToB4A.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*PzdSSk-TdTd8582Ajb7E2g.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=104536c76da8" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/adobe-experience-manager-add-links-to-your-internal-and-external-tools-in-touch-ui-104536c76da8">Adobe Experience Manager — Add links to your internal and external tools in Touch UI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“Websites promote your brand 24/7: No employee will ever do that for you. It works continuously for you whilst you sleep!”</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PKR98EaVr3kGhaAFZ9ty2Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>Your website is, in our modern world, usually<strong> the first impression </strong>your client gets of your organization. To make the best of this moment, it’s very important to provide all the necessary information your visitors are looking for.</p><p>However, many websites I come across forget many (simple?) details, <strong>making them lose out on potential clients.</strong></p><p>In this article I am going to give a brief summary of <strong>the 10 most important elements</strong> which should be present on your website and why. I am also going to give some tips on how you can address these.</p><p>Let’s go!</p><h3>1) A Fast Loading Speed</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/467/0*CxJHLGtivopN5K0v.png" /></figure><p>People in our current society have <strong>”information overload”.</strong></p><p>Think about advertisements, video’s, 9Gag, YouTube and different social media channels<strong> who all combat for our attention.</strong></p><p>The information-influx is enormous.</p><p>The easiest way — then — to navigate this <strong>gigantic pile of information</strong> is to simply ignore most of it.</p><p>And that’s exactly what most do.</p><p>The average attention-span of a person is incredibly short these days and that’s exactly why <strong>you can’t let them wait.</strong></p><p>Research shows that when your webpage<strong> loads slower than 4 seconds, you lose (on average) 25% of potential clients</strong>.(1)</p><p>Therefore, every second you can cut from your loading time can potentially lead to extra customers.</p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/">Measure your current website speed here.</a></li><li>If you have a wordpress site and you’re able to tweak it a little bit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eAnQj0u7aE">this video</a> might help you get a long way.</li><li>Do you have a website built on another framework? Then you can always check the recommended adjustments under “performance insights” at the bottom of the test.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1009/0*pM0DWGlqLDKsMP-G.JPG" /></figure><h3>2) Great SEO</h3><p>SEO, or search engine optimization, covers how easy it is for search engines like Google to;</p><ol><li>Find your website</li><li>Understand what it is about</li></ol><p>Now, <strong>why is this important?</strong></p><p>Simple! Google uses this information to show your pages to people searching for your products or services! If — however — your webpages are poorly made (or unclear), you’ll be far more likely to rank at the bottom of Google and therefore<strong> miss out on potential clients!</strong></p><p>Imagine you’ve recently started a bike-shop in New York. Then it would be <strong>great</strong> if your website would pop up as the first result in Google when people type ‘bike shop new york’. Don’t you agree?</p><p>By optimizing your SEO you’ll be able to rank a lot higher! And ranking higher <strong>automatically means more customers!</strong></p><p><em>“Now, is it really </em><strong><em>that</em></strong><em> important to rank so high?”</em></p><p>Yes!</p><p>Because, <strong>the first three links in Google get about 65% of the natural search-volume (clicks)!</strong> That’s 34%, 19% and 12% for the first three links respectively! (2)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1002/0*G_CT_bZwKHmFjT4z.png" /></figure><p>The higher you rank, the more people will click on your website basically. And by quite a significant margin!</p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><p>There’s two main ways you can improve this;<strong> onsite/internal SEO </strong>and<strong> offsite/external SEO</strong></p><h4>2.1) Onsite SEO</h4><p>The first can be improved by making your website more clear and “readable” for Google. You can do this by supplying your pages with keywords, using a clear meta-description for each page and also having a clear link structure (among others).</p><p>For example;</p><ul><li>GOOD: <a href="http://www.website.com/article-about-health">www.website.com/article-about-health</a> 👍</li><li>BAD: <a href="http://www.website.com/2016/08/03/aspx?article%20about%20health">www.website.com/2016/08/03/aspx?article%20about%20health</a> 👎</li></ul><p>Here are some more tips;</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.seocentro.com/tools/seo/seo-analyzer.html">This website can give you more insight on how well your company site is optimized for Google!</a></li><li>If you have a WordPress-based website, it’s highly recommended to install the “<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">Yoast-SEO</a>” plugin. This will automatically configure a lot for you.</li><li>If you have a website based on another framework, you can again check the test recommendations to further improve your company site.</li></ul><h4>2.2) Offsite SEO</h4><p>The second part is a bit more challenging (but actually a more important ranking factor). This is determined by <strong>the authority of your website, </strong>or how relevant Google thinks your website is. This is mainly determined by <strong>the amount of incoming links (also called backlinks).</strong></p><p>This means, if other websites link to your site (through an article, for example), they signal Google saying; “Hey, this content is pretty interesting!”.</p><p><strong>Google then uses this information to see how different websites “stack up” against each other.</strong></p><p>Of course, <strong>not every backlink is weighed the same</strong>. Websites that have a high authority carry more “link-weight” and influence your ranking more.</p><p>So getting a link from a news-website like The Times, ABCnews, CNN an so-forth, will influence your rankings more significantly than your grandma’s social media account.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since Google doesn’t give the public 100% insight into how they <strong>exactly</strong> rank websites, most of the literature on this is our “best educated guess”.</p><p>Here’s some things you can do;</p><ul><li>Make social media pages with backlinks to your website (and write articles on it, which get shared).</li><li>Make <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/add/show">a company page on LinkedIn</a> and point it at your website.</li><li>Make <a href="https://www.google.com/business/">a company page on Google Maps</a> and point it at your site.</li><li>Subscribe to directory sites like the yellow pages (and others).</li><li>Publicise articles on sites with more authority and have a backlink in the bio (also called ‘guest-posting’).</li></ul><h3>3) A Mobile Version</h3><p><strong>About 50% of all Google-searches are coming from mobile devices (</strong>tablet or smartphones) since the end of 2014. This is an incredibly high number and will probably rise more the coming years!</p><blockquote>“In fact, more Google searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan. This presents a tremendous opportunity for marketers to reach people throughout all the new touch-points of a consumer’s path to purchase.” (3) <br><strong>- Google Adwords</strong></blockquote><p>Your visitors will be inclined to close a website that’s not optimized for mobile devices (just think about how <strong>you</strong> judge mobile websites).</p><p>That’s why it’s important to <strong>show an adjusted version of your website to mobile users</strong>. Otherwise, you could potentially lose out on over half of your potential clients.</p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/business/">You can check here if your website has a mobile-friendly design.</a></li><li>If you’re running a WordPress-based website, it’s a great idea to get a mobile-friendly theme. Most are these days, but it never hurts to check.</li><li>If you’re running a website based on another framework, I’d recommend to call in a developer for this (since optimization for mobile devices can become rather complex). If — however — you’re up for the challenge, <a href="http://zellwk.com/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css/">I suggest starting here.</a></li></ul><h3>4) Clear Info About Your Product Or Service</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/0*3njn75_fe6B3Wey8.png" /></figure><p><strong>Don’t make your users search endlessly for information about your products and services.</strong></p><p>When somebody visits your company site, they’re usually searching for a description of your products and services, your working process or, in short, the benefits they can derive from working with you.</p><p>So, it seems logical to include <strong>a clear overview</strong> of these in your website, right?</p><p>Despite this, I see websites <strong>daily </strong>where this information is hard to find or even absent!</p><p>The easier it is for your visitors to visualize <strong>exactly </strong>what you’re offering, the better.</p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><ul><li>Provide your website with some detailed pages of your services and products. Let someone outside of your industry read it, to see if it’s understandable to a layman.</li><li>Add pictures to visualize your offer (<strong>don’t underestimate this</strong>).</li></ul><h3>5) Detailed Contact Information</h3><p>Your contact information can lead directly to a new customer, so don’t hide this in some obscure spot on your website but <strong>always make it plainly available in sight.</strong></p><p><strong>Also:</strong> Be as detailed as possible! Give your customers multiple ways of contacting you, so you can keep the barrier to contact you as low as possible.</p><p>Here are a few key elements you should include;</p><ul><li>Your name</li><li>Your address</li><li>Your telephone number</li><li>Your email</li><li>Your social media accounts</li><li>A contact form</li></ul><h3>6) No Unnecessary Distractions/Gimmicks</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/530/0*1UtRlxakt8U3nY4A.png" /></figure><p>Furthermore, it is recommended to keep your site <strong>as simplistic as possible.</strong></p><p>If you want your visitors to focus on what is really important, you should <strong>make sure not to distract them with useless things</strong> like sidebars, chaotic animations, pop-ups, that occupy the entire screen or simply a chaotic layout of your website.</p><p>If your visitors do not immediately understand your site, they will not hesitate to close the window.</p><p>The purpose of a website is ultimately to inform the user of your services, give them access to your contact information and to help them make an informed decision. Ensure that this can happen <strong>effortlessly</strong>.</p><p>A modern trend here is to use a “One-Page” design where all critical information is displayed on the main page instead of the user having to click through to individual pages.</p><p>Designs like <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/truetech-v3/blog/one2.png">this</a> and <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/truetech-v3/blog/one1.png">this one</a> are some examples.</p><p>Many people do not have the patience nor focus to read a whole page, let alone browse a full site and, therefore, just scroll and skim over the content to get a quick overview. As such, it is a good idea to <strong>provide the key information</strong> <strong>bundled on your homepage.</strong></p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><ul><li>Make the life of your user easier by setting up a minimalist site without too many bells and whistles.</li><li>If you have a WordPress website, it is recommended to choose a theme that shows the most essential information on the first page. <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/best-one-page-wordpress-themes/">Here</a> you can find an extensive overview.</li><li>No annoying/shaking full-screen pop-ups. The best way to tackle the design is to ask yourself; “What kind of site would I like to read/follow?”</li></ul><h3>7) FAQ section</h3><p>People usually have further questions about your products and services;</p><ul><li>Do I get a money-back-guarantee? How long is it valid?</li><li>Can I take this supplement with medication x?</li><li>How much will the cost be with the addition of option y?</li></ul><p><strong>Try to anticipate these questions in advance </strong>(or regularly update them) using a list of frequently asked questions which guides your users through some common problems. This way, you create a win-win situation!</p><p>On the one hand you can <strong>spend more time on what really matters — </strong>namely the development of your business — and on the other hand, your user can easily retrieve the information they need.</p><p>Here’s an example of what an FAQ section looks like;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/869/0*QL9BhhuU9UPD8KyF.JPG" /></figure><h3>8) A Mailing List</h3><blockquote>“The power is in the list”</blockquote><p>Building a mailing list is one of the elements that is<strong> often neglected </strong>on company websites, although a mailing list is probably <strong>one of the best ways to stay in touch with your clients</strong>, even after your collaboration has ended.</p><p>This is ideal to <strong>keep the relationship with your client going</strong>, to <strong>update them of new developments</strong> within the organization and also to<strong> present yourself as an expert</strong> in your industry. These are all elements that you can use to build your brand.</p><p>In addition, an email list is also a good medium to <strong>increase engagement on your website</strong>.</p><p>When users subscribe to your email list, you usually have a (higher) assurance that they will actually read it. Through social media, your posts mostly just “blend into the masses” by the continous amount of information that’s flushing through their news feed.</p><p>Given that <strong>it is increasingly difficult to attract the attention of potential clients</strong>, a mailing list is <strong>a powerful (and indispensable) weapon</strong> in your marketing.</p><p>Of course, you should keep in mind that <strong>no one likes spam</strong>, so if you betray their trust (even just once) they’ll remove you immediately and irrevocably out of their inbox.</p><p>If — however — you can show them that you respect their time/attention and that you continuously send them useful information, they will eventually trust you and allow you to send them information.</p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><ul><li>Add a form to your website where your users can sign up for your email list. Something often forgotten, believe it or not!</li><li>Create relevant articles that your visitors can apply to their lives.</li></ul><h3>9) Testimonials</h3><p>Testimonials are by far <strong>the best way to convince potential visitors who are still doubting!</strong> The greatest portfolio of a company is simply how the previous customers have experienced the cooperation with the organization. If you have a good “track record” of successful projects, business will come naturally.</p><p>Think of <strong>how you choose products or services when you’re still doubting;</strong></p><ul><li>If you buy a book, you first look at the reviews before you make the purchase.</li><li>If you want to see a movie, you see the reviews or ask someone you know for a movie recommendation.</li></ul><p><strong>The same applies for any other choice. </strong>People learn A LOT by observing the behavior of others and are strongly influenced by it.</p><p><strong>How can you do this?</strong></p><ul><li>The best way to implement this, is to give a detailed outline of the situation in which the doubting visitor finds himself in. Put yourself in his/her shoes and ask yourself, <strong>“What is important to him/her”</strong>. Show that previous customers had similar doubts, but nevertheless have made ​​the move and do not regret their purchase decision.</li></ul><h3>10) A Personal Touch</h3><p><strong>People do not do business with a website. People do business with other humans. A personal touch can make sure that you stand out from the crowd and that you “humanize” the contact with your clients.</strong></p><p>By adding a mascot, a personal business video, an “about us” page, some humor or even a custom error page, you can <strong>make your business stand out from the crowd.</strong></p><p>A good example is the company <a href="http://sayviget.com/">“Viget”</a>, who have made a game to help the user pronounce the name of the organization (definitely worth watching!).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/0*N7ucVHErMt-P8KpO.png" /></figure><p>Another example is the custom error page of <a href="http://bluegg.co.uk/404">“Bluegg”</a>,<strong> </strong>giving you the choice to go back to the homepage or listen to a goat “scream like a human”. Easy choice ;)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Xg5nQg87AOgRtNC8.png" /></figure><p><strong>A small gift, a funny picture or an interesting insight can do wonders to build the relationship with your visitors!</strong></p><h3>Essence</h3><p>There you have it! Building a good website isn’t as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>With some minor adjustments you can improve your site a lot! </strong>Use the tips and tricks outlined in this article to catapult your user experience and web-image to the top!</p><p>Provide it with;</p><blockquote>- A Fast Loading Time<br>- Great SEO<br>- A Beautiful Mobile Version<br>- Detailed Information About Your Product Or Service<br>- Extensive Contact Information<br>- No Distractions<br>- An FAQ section<br>- A Mailing List<br>- Testimonials<br>- A Personal Touch</blockquote><p>That’s all it takes!</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><ol><li><a href="http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/">http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.advancedwebranking.com/ctrstudy/">https://www.advancedwebranking.com/ctrstudy/</a></li><li><a href="https://adwords.googleblog.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html">https://adwords.googleblog.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html</a></li><li><a href="https://moz.com/blog/google-organic-click-through-rates-in-2014">https://moz.com/blog/google-organic-click-through-rates-in-2014</a></li></ol><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*4Ok5LRR3a7Le46_8VYUrkg.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/nl/jobs.html"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*Rhx4HftRDGUKmhd84o5OBA.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*GCn4hsea5PHOzgprWToB4A.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=9c178eec5ec8" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/10-essential-elements-of-a-great-website-9c178eec5ec8">10 Essential Elements Of A Great Website</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>The impact of Digital Transformation on IT consultancies and how Service Design can help you serve your clients better</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vbqSD5TQkOs0DQ238U8wlA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>Introduction</h4><p>Digital Transformation and Service Design both seem to be just buzzwords. Especially Digital Transformation is used by more and more companies to indicate that they are changing services, adding webshops, doing whatever they can to become &quot;digital&quot;.</p><p>There is a huge difference though between simply adding some digital interfaces for others to interact with, and becoming truly digital at your core.</p><p>As IT consultancies, we are not excempt of this transformation. Even though we might think we are. Our customers are the companies that are struggling to become digital, to survive the disruptive nature of digital transformation, and to keep themselves afloat whatever it takes.</p><p>This means that we need to think beyond our current service model, and that&#39;s where Service Design comes in.</p><h4>What is Digital Transformation?</h4><p>Before we go any further, let&#39;s dig a little deeper into Digital Transformation and what that means today.</p><p>Digital Transformation refers to the cultural, economical, and societal changes caused by a few new players who throw out the standard rules of a market and break with convention. While most are not even making profit, they change the way consumers act towards your market. This causes huge disruptions.</p><p>Think about players like Zalando, Bol.com, and Amazon who are disrupting the retail sector, players like Netflix who disrupted the video rental market, iTunes for purchasing music, Spotify who started challenging iTunes on their turn, …</p><p>I think we can safely assume that these disruptions have only just started and, at this point, it&#39;s hard to predict just how much our current way of doing things and current business models will still change.</p><p>Therefore, the goal right now is not to find the best service offering for clients in today&#39;s market, but the goal is to start preparing your business for a fast-changing environment where you will need to be able to change at a moment&#39;s notice.</p><h4>How does this impact IT consultancy companies?</h4><p>As IT consultancy companies, we are digital at our core, and we know better than anyone just how much our solutions can help our customers grow their business from a technical perspective.</p><p>However, our job doesn&#39;t end there.</p><p>As mentioned in the intro of this post, our customers are the very ones that are struggling to stay afloat while their entire market changes at a rapid pace.</p><p>Sure, we could simply make them a new website, a mobile application, we can even help them implement personalised marketing campaigns and a personalised experience on their website, … This will help them bring a more digital experience to their customers, but it doesn&#39;t help them to become digital at their core.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*YIw8eFCpCO9QuKmMKrADuA.jpeg" /></figure><h4>That&#39;s where Service Design comes in</h4><p>Service Design is all about offering your customers what they really need, going beyond simply offering them the product they requested, and creating a service for them that will truly help them move forward.</p><p>This fits perfectly into the situation explained above.</p><p>As our customers are struggling to simply stay afloat in their changing markets, offering a technical solution is not always enough. I strongly believe there is a huge benefit to be gained when you start helping your customers to completely transform their businesses, helping them to become digital at their core.</p><p>It may seem like a tough sell, but let&#39;s be real here. Not many companies are going to stay afloat in the coming years with ever-changing business rules and the constant threat of start-up companies who can offer what they do way simpler and cheaper.</p><p>The question is not if a company will go under if they don&#39;t change anything, it&#39;s when.</p><p>As IT consultants, we need to broaden our range of services to support our clients on a business level too, if we really want to help our customers survive their market disruptions.</p><p>What do you think will help your customers more? Creating a new web interface that will give them the idea that they are embracing Digital Transformation, or giving them insights into what Digital Transformation really is and helping them come up with a new business model structure that can help them pivot in the next few years, indirectly also binding this customer to you for years to come?</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanadirkx/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*uYNN5c6fNXTReaMl9Hk7Yw.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*GCn4hsea5PHOzgprWToB4A.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*PzdSSk-TdTd8582Ajb7E2g.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=581ab03b6e7a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/digital-transformation-581ab03b6e7a">How to survive as an IT Consultancy firm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Kind words for generation Y</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Lm67S_0BApjUuoCjVCCFXg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Today I am writing my first -woohoo- blog post on Medium and, given my work as a solutions architect, the usual suspects to write about would be things like coding, architecture, and whatnot. Although tempting, and probably easier to write about, I wanted to start with something positive.</p><p>I often hear older folk complaining about how everything used to be better in the past. They tend to get carried away with nostalgia and, I gotta hand it to them, they did make some incredible cars back in the day.</p><p>They also rejoice when pointing out how today’s generation is not as motivated as they were back in the day. They worked their asses off, had an incredible work ethic and actually did something with their lives. Sounds familiar?</p><blockquote>“They lack the motivation, perseverance and work ethic.”</blockquote><p>Well, I don’t know about that one though… Let&#39;s agree to <strong>disagree</strong>.</p><p>First up, I was born in the year of our lord 1984 and, since I am in my mid 30s, I can no longer consider myself a greenhorn. Then again, according to my bff wikipedia, I am still labeled a millennial (cfr. ~1980–1995) and thus kind of in the mids of an identity crisis. Not to worry though, in the end, I am just me. I don’t believe in labels anyway and, although I have many, many flaws, I don’t think I lack any of the above traits the elderly attribute to generation Y.</p><h3>Work ethic, you say?</h3><p>As a solutions architect, I work with young people all the time. Not a day goes by in which they cease to amaze me in some kind of way. Truth be told, they make mistakes all the time, but don&#39;t we all? I sure as hell do.</p><p>The thing I seem to notice though is that they are transparent about their struggles and don’t dwell on mistakes that much. This is exactly the kind of open culture that we expect from our colleagues at the company I work at <a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/">(iDA Mediafoundry)</a> because it fosters cooperation and trust within our team. In my time as a junior, I tended to be less open about my struggles because I had this strange belief that I had to ace at everything I did, and it took me a while to understand that I shouldn’t be so insecure about my lack of knowledge or skills. It’s a process you have to go through and that takes time.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/892/1*9Zh2R6N4c8Bo0DcMdi_FhQ.png" /><figcaption>from Monty Python and the holy grail</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing I observe, is that they tend to keep a positive mindset while inevitably bumping into the next challenge that comes along their digital crusade. As true knights in search of their holy grail, they just dive in head first with a can-do, will struggle, don’t mind, keep calm and carry on, “Que Sera, Sera”, and by-the-way-live-a-little attitude.</p><p>Everything seems to bounce off some kind of invisible armour.</p><p>Although I know that’s not entirely true, they do possess the power of optimism, very similar to the Black Knight in Monty Python&#39;s timeless scene in <em>the Holy Grail</em>. And, just like the Black Knight, that makes them vulnerable. It goes without saying that I would like them to keep all their limbs during their career, but I do remind them from time to time that it’s okay to fail as long as we persevere in our quest to become better in what we do.</p><h3>Persevere you must, young padawans.</h3><p>Just the other day, one of my gen Y colleagues decided to pull an all-nighter because he thought it was a point of honour to reach a deadline. While I very much appreciate the incredible perseverance that was displayed, I had to insist that he&#39;d take the day off. Obviously, we overestimated our joint team capacity and — as a result — we were not going to catch our deadline anyway.</p><p>Although, from time to time, we need to show our teeth and grind it out by going the extra mile, in this case the team decided that it was not possible to reach the deadline and thus revised a plan to be able to close the gap in the next sprint.</p><p>However, as far as perseverance goes, I think the anecdote above proves that we can not generalize the fact that generation Y has a lack thereof.</p><blockquote>“Perseverantia omnia vincit”</blockquote><p>You also often hear the quote: <em>“it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon”</em>, and within the field of digital this is so very true because it is such a multi-disciplinary journey to embark on. The expertise required is so extensive that it takes time to become an expert even in only a small subset of the digital ecosystem.</p><p>The drive required to get there must be fuelled by tremendous passion and when combined with work ethic and perseverance, in time we can get to the sweet spot of excellence in our field of digital.</p><h3>Motivation is key</h3><p>What is it that motivates our generation Y colleagues?</p><p>The incredible author of the book <em>Start With Why</em>, Simon Sinek stated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hER0Qp6QJNU&amp;t=59s">an interview</a> in 2016 that the things they pursue in life are being able to make an impact and to work in a place with purpose.</p><p>Well the good thing for them is that, in the field of digital, young talent makes all the difference in the world. They have the talent of youth which brings things to the table like out-of-the-box thinking, endless enthusiasm and a passion for technology. So, as far as I am concerned, making an impact is definitely within their grasp — at least if they can stay motivated.</p><p>However, Simon also states that they are rather impatient. I, myself, perceive this as their biggest adversary. I am convinced that, if the impatience would take over, they would never be able to live up to the big expectations they have set for themselves.</p><p>The best advice I have to give is to take your time to live up to these big expectations and, if you are in a bit of struggle, well, simply ask for help. Your senior colleagues will be happy to help. After all, it gives them a sense of purpose as well, you know ;-)</p><p>So plan ahead and accept the fact that it takes time to mature into new roles during the long and exhausting marathon that is your career. and know that it is okay to fail as long as you pull together and persevere in becoming the best version of yourself.</p><p>Yours truly.</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bertswinnen/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*O-r4PZfH4Y7yHErG6b9YxQ.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*24UXH5TPH4VCqsx1LhBzAg.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*HxprJR4afmWbGfoA1-Wh1A.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ec77a3f3cdeb" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/generation-y-ec77a3f3cdeb">Kind words for generationY.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Top tips you need to know when you start working as a design consultant — part 3 (final)</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*-cRX1ERcw9RpL48_-LjlBw.jpeg" /></figure><p>When you’ve read the previous posts in this series, you are probably thinking that these tips are interesting but easier said than done. Well, that&#39;s true, and I didn&#39;t want you to leave without getting some more actionable tips so this last part of the series focuses on very specific and concrete examples that you can implement right away.</p><h4>Shorten your design process</h4><p>If you design a lot of screens and you never show your progress to others, it&#39;s quite likely that you will have to start all over again once you finally ask someone for feedback. It&#39;s so easy to make assumptions and you need to verify that you&#39;re on the right track before you get too lost in the details.</p><blockquote>Tip № 1: Always verify your assumptions early-on</blockquote><p>During my internship, I made this very mistake. I was designing an application for a car dashboard. I developed a style that I was happy about and applied it to several screens without asking for feedback because I felt very confident about it (like most designers).</p><p>In the end, though, I was quite disappointed with myself because I overlooked a lot of things that I didn’t think about at first. Instead of asking for feedback early-on, when I had one screen ready, I asked for it when I had most screens designed already and I ended up re-designing every single one of them.</p><p><strong>My conclusion</strong>:<br>Try to apply the PRRI Process ( Prototype, Review, Refine &amp; Iterate )<br>Make an idea → Get feedback → Improve your idea → Repeat</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/796/1*yukLi3BZBDhWK0PUUbhWhw.jpeg" /><figcaption>PRRI Process</figcaption></figure><h4>Think about your clients</h4><p>When creating a homepage design, for example, try to start with the basics. Some designers start getting into the details almost immediately, sometimes presenting 10 different homepage designs to a client with only minimal differences between them all. This can be very confusing for your client and can quickly overwhelm them.</p><blockquote>Tip № 2: Don’t focus on <strong>too</strong> detailed designs too early in the process</blockquote><p>When minor details differ in each of your design, it&#39;s hard for a client to see the difference. To them, all ten designs look exactly the same because they skim over the details that you might find important. A better idea is to start with 2 different themes on a high level basis and try to go into details later in your process. This will help the client see the differences more clearly, because they&#39;re a lot more distinctive.</p><blockquote>Tip № 3: Design with real content</blockquote><p>When I first got started, I got a lot of feedback from clients about text that wasn’t correctly placed or used. Even though you&#39;re responsible for the design, not the content, your client sees this as a flaw in your design and will call you out on it. You might not always get content from your client, but I strongly recommend to create or find some content that fits your design.</p><p>Content can make or break your proposal, don&#39;t overlook it!</p><p>Looking at a homepage design of a sneaker shop with sneaker-oriented call-to-actions and sneaker images, is much more eye-pleasing and easier to relate to for your client. Remember, they need to understand (and approve) your design so putting it in the right context will make that alignment easier for both of you.</p><h4>Create designs that developers can work with</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*UQBqPzPmnS2Kl1si2XmM6g.png" /></figure><p>I honestly believe we can create a whole series of blog posts just about bridging the gap between design and development so you might see something like that appear in the future.</p><p>For now, let&#39;s start with some basics.</p><blockquote>Tip № 4: Create unhappy flows</blockquote><p>When you work from an unhappy-flow-mindset, the developers you work with are going to appreciate it immensely. Especially when you’re designing interfaces for Content Management Systems in complex multi-language environments, you need to think about unhappy flow designs.</p><p>The companies we work with often have a CMS with &gt;15 different languages, content the author of the website will not manually author for each language. Usually, they simply upload translations and don&#39;t have the time or resources to check each language to see if the design still fits. This is where your happy flows become extremely interesting.</p><p>Whatever you design, keep in mind that text can be longer, images might not render in the correct sizes, lists can be longer or shorter, columns might span wider than expected, etc. This will save you a lot of time down the road and will prevent your development team to have to come up with a solution on their own when the story is already pulled into a sprint and you might not be involved in the project anymore.</p><blockquote>Tip № 5: Create a design system</blockquote><p>When you are working on bigger projects, it&#39;s always best to start with a design system. A design system is a full set of design standards, documentation and principles, and a toolkit with UI patterns and code examples.</p><p>Not only will it make it easier to work on the same project with multiple designers, it will also make handover to another designer a lot easier when someone else takes over the project, and it helps your development team because they can rely on the fact that you are using the same design building blocks throughout the whole website so they can standardise their way of working as well.</p><p>I strongly believe in the benefits of a design system, so the next design blog post on our iDA channel will be all about design systems. Stay tuned :-)</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradewinterdesign/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*XBARx0uyY64VB_q0A4YNfQ.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*GCn4hsea5PHOzgprWToB4A.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.lauradewinterdesign.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*-HkIcOMsCzk0jV8ujMz_Xw.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d45b789a0b3a" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/validation-in-the-real-world-d45b789a0b3a">Talking about design: Validation in the real world</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Top tips you need to know when you start working as a design consultant — part 2</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*kBMqMj0WRxe42Tdh-LL9pg.jpeg" /></figure><p>Creating and shaping interfaces for your clients is your main task as a designer. However, this affects your creativity and inspiration. All designers know the feeling of not getting anything on your artboard, of an empty mind, no inspiration, no creativity, and an empty screen.</p><p>You can’t predict these moments but, when they occur, I have a few tips to help you out.</p><p><em>Did you miss our post on </em><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/the-feedback-loop-59449647c2b4"><strong><em>the feedback loop</em></strong></a><strong><em>? </em></strong><em>Don&#39;t forget to read this first part of our &quot;top tips for designers&quot; series!</em></p><h4>Get an outside perspective</h4><blockquote>Tip № 1: Read blogs and apply the ‘lessons learned’ to your own designs.</blockquote><p>A lot of people search for inspiration by Googling around, which is good, but I would recommend reading a lot of blogs in particular. Reading blogs helped me improve my skills as a designer tremendously and it&#39;s a great way to make some quick wins in your design evolution.</p><p>After reading a blog, apply the ‘lessons learned’ on examples you’ve made in the past, just to exercise.</p><p>When taking your personal evolution to the next level, I also recommend you to read blogs about unrelated design subjects too. Think about marketing, SEO, UX, leadership etc.. This will widen your knowledge on all the aspects good design needs to align with, or influences.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*7-HMijWB6HsM06oLW4ApCA.jpeg" /><figcaption><a href="http://tonyjuliendesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/design-process-main.jpg">http://tonyjuliendesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/design-process-main.jpg</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>Tip № 2: Critique other people’s work</blockquote><p>Another idea is to start looking at other people&#39;s designs. Don&#39;t just review independent designers but also look at the bigger brands. Try to think about why a design approach was chosen and why it seems to be a good solution. And, if you can’t figure it out, try to Google some background information on why a design was chosen so you can see the reasoning behind it.</p><blockquote>Tip № 3: Talk to other creatives and non-creatives</blockquote><p>It might be something you don&#39;t immediately think about, but try to talk to people who are creative in another way than you are. For example, talk to developers or managers and really listen to how they view a certain subject. You will be surprised at the outcome!</p><p>Also, having a chat with the designers around you is very important. Sometimes, I see my fellow-designers staring at their screens, completely lost in thought. Once, I saw someone stare at the same design for almost 3 hours. In the end, I decided to approach that person by asking how things were going. By simply giving some input and feedback, that person was able to get unstuck and create a new and improved design only half an hour later.</p><h4>Be creative</h4><blockquote>Tip № 4: Keep triggering your own creativity</blockquote><p>When you have lots of inspiration, it&#39;s also easier to be creative. I always try to trigger creativity by starting over and over with the same goal, but with a different approach. The only rule I follow is to create something totally different from the previous designs until I have a decent amount of different approaches. This keeps me from getting stuck too easily, and it&#39;s a really good way to ideate on my work.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*pk-RskBKXowfaMDatQzd_g.png" /><figcaption><a href="http://alirezabahrami.ir/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/matheson-process.jpg">http://alirezabahrami.ir/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/matheson-process.jpg</a></figcaption></figure><blockquote>Tip № 5: Learn to love change &amp; spice things up</blockquote><p>As a designer, you need to love changing things all the time. This way, you keep challenging yourself.</p><p>I change things every time I start a new project or design. This helps me create the ultimate working method which will ultimately increase my design process. I keep looking for the best way to name files or layers, the best structure in tools, potential new tools we can start using, and so on.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Long story short, my key tip to stay inspired and creative is to communicate about it with different people in the process. A second pair of eyes is always good to have.</p><p>If you have any other top tips that could help me or other designers stay creative and inspired, please comment below.</p><p>In our third and final post of this series, coming up soon, I will talk about the validation of designs in the real world. Be on the lookout for this next post!</p><figure><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauradewinterdesign/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*XBARx0uyY64VB_q0A4YNfQ.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*24UXH5TPH4VCqsx1LhBzAg.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.lauradewinterdesign.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*-HkIcOMsCzk0jV8ujMz_Xw.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d406339f5f52" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/talking-about-design-stay-inspired-d406339f5f52">Talking about design: stay inspired</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

         <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Expects the reader to have a basic knowledge of coding (responsive) emails</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*o6hiCteU7wHTzKhTauIPzg.jpeg" /></figure><p>I already had some experience involving the creation of (responsive) emails, but as it turns out with my latest project, there is still much to learn. You always keep your fingers crossed when you put your HTML to the test on whatever email testing platform you use, hoping the result isn’t too bad.</p><p>You’d expect, being 2018, that email design would evolve over time like web design did, but no, it didn’t… If you ask me, it became even worse, looking back on the last decade.</p><p>There are some solutions in the shape of frameworks that do much of the heavy lifting for you, for example <a href="https://mjml.io/">MJML</a> and <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html">Foundation for Emails</a> to name a few. And that’s great, but I’m not sold on them yet.</p><blockquote>Frameworks bring issues…</blockquote><p>Something doesn’t work or something else is not possible, maybe there is some code bloating etc. Call me old-fashioned, but I still prefer making my emails in plain old tables without the need of learning/using framework syntax that transpiles into HTML.</p><p>In this two-part special, I will cover the most common — and lesser common — pitfalls regarding coding emails. So, without further ado…</p><h4>Using web fonts in emails</h4><p>For this first issue, I stumbled upon an <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-web-fonts">article</a> with a possible solution. I used the method that they find most bulletproof: the @font-face method. They describe how you can get the CSS by copy/pasting the web font URL in the browser, et voilà… It returns the font format that is best for that particular browser.</p><p>But what if you want all web font formats, like I do i.e. eot, ttf, svg, woff and woff2? What do you do then? Looking up which browser serves what format, download that browser and copy/paste the web font URL in each and every one of them?</p><p>No. A colleague of mine gave me a tip: <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator">fontsquirrel’s web font generator</a>. In case of a Google Font, download the font you selected and upload the font styles you want to generate. Select the ‘Expert’ option, because ttf, eot and svg are not generated by default. The only thing I changed is the Truetype Hinting which I set to ‘Keep Existing’, because I assume Google optimized it already.</p><p>Once downloaded, you will find a CSS file which contains all font-faces:</p><pre><a href="http://twitter.com/font">@font</a>-face {<br> font-family: &#39;latobold&#39;;<br> ...<br> font-weight: normal;<br> font-style: normal;<br>}</pre><pre>@font-face {<br> font-family: &#39;latobold_italic&#39;;<br> ...<br> font-weight: normal;<br> font-style: normal;<br>}</pre><p>What I suggest you do is make the font-family name generic and set the styling accordingly.</p><pre>@font-face {<br> font-family: &#39;Lato&#39;;<br> ...<br> font-weight: bold;<br> font-style: normal;<br>}</pre><pre>@font-face {<br> font-family: &#39;Lato&#39;;<br> ...<br> font-weight: bold;<br> font-style: italic;<br>}</pre><p>That way, you only have one name per font-family, which is much easier. The last thing you need to do is serve the font files on your server and change the source URL’s and that’s it!</p><h4>What about email clients that do not support web fonts?</h4><p>Easy, you just provide a fallback font in your styling:</p><pre>font-family: ‘Lato’, Helvetica, sans-serif;</pre><p>This turned out to be too easy though.</p><p>If you would test this in Outlook, you would notice that nor the Lato, nor the Helvetica font is rendered, but Times New Roman. No matter what font you choose as fallback, it keeps going back to the Times one. There are some hacks (as described in the article I mentioned in the beginning), so I went for the second one: the media query.</p><p>Turns out not only Outlook ignores everything inside a media query, by the way, Internet Explorer does as well. So, if you want to view your email in the browser and that browser happens to be IE, you will see your fallback font rendered.</p><p>No problem, the conditional comment hack works for Outlook too, without breaking anything else in the process. Just use the class everywhere you use your font-family property and you’re done, right?</p><p>Well… there is a catch. Take the following example:</p><pre>&lt;table class=&quot;header fontFallback&quot;&gt;</pre><p>Outlook will not find the fontFallback class therefore will not render the fallback because it only renders one class and it’s the first one. The solution is to put it at the beginning, take a deep breath and leave your frustrations behind you.</p><p>Your work is done (for real now).</p><h4>A thing about buttons and emails</h4><p>The days of using an image as a button, belongs to the past (I used to do that, you know). It was just easier this way because making it look good for all mail clients was a real pain in the… well, you know what I&#39;m getting at.</p><p>Nowadays, there are more than enough solutions to help you out, and I found mine <a href="https://litmus.com/blog/a-guide-to-bulletproof-buttons-in-email-design">here</a>: the padding + border-based approach. It just works!</p><p>Couple of side notes:</p><ul><li>You have to include a border or the padding won’t render in Outlook</li><li>I explicitly set the line-height as well because the button would be higher on Pixel Outlook if you choose not to include it</li></ul><h4>Making emails responsive</h4><p>If putting emails together with tables and inline styling isn’t hard and time-consuming enough, try to make them responsive. With more and more people using their mobile devices to read mails, there is no more escaping the responsive-game.</p><blockquote>If you want to be taken seriously and look professional towards your subscribers when sending out your email campaign, you have to go responsive!</blockquote><p>I used to have two responsive style blocks: one at the bottom, before the closing body tag, and one in the head tag.</p><p>Why are there two you ask? In March 2015, Yahoo supported the use of media queries on mobile, but it didn’t allow style tags in the head. The fix was to put it in the body, easy. But then you have Gmail on mobile, which only supports style tags in head and not in the body.</p><p><em>Before Yahoo media query support, you had to use attribute selectors in your responsive styling due to a </em><a href="https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/stop_yahoo_mail_from_rendering_your_media_queries/"><em>bug</em></a><em> in Yahoo. Attribute selectors in Gmail, on the other hand, are not supported.</em></p><p>Anyway, there is a hack to make Yahoo stop stripping your style and that is by adding another (empty) head tag above your main head tag, This way Yahoo strips the first head tag and leaves the other one containing your styling alone. This is great, because this means you can remove the responsive styling inside your body tag. Awesome!</p><h4><strong>Showing/hiding content in responsive emails</strong></h4><p>Let&#39;s say you have two elements, one for desktop and one for mobile. By default you want to hide the mobile version, so you add display: none to the inline styling of your wrapper element. The web version of Yahoo mail doesn’t seem to care about the statement because it will just show the mobile version.</p><pre>&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; class=&quot;mobile&quot; style=&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;<br> &lt;tr&gt;<br>  &lt;td&gt;Mobile content&lt;/td&gt;<br> &lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</pre><p>This can easily be fixed by adding the following in your style tag above your media query:</p><pre>.mobile {<br> display: none;<br>}</pre><p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: you might think that the inline declaration is now redundant, but I would suggest you leave it there. For some reason your responsive version doesn’t work (anymore) on Outlook for mobile. Without the declaration it would display the mobile content as well.</p><p>Who knew hiding something would be such a hassle?</p><p>Luckily showing something on mobile is more straightforward:</p><pre>@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {<br> .mobile {<br>  display: none !important;<br> }<br>}</pre><p>This will work (sighs), but not on Yahoo mobile…</p><p>There are a couple of properties that do not work if the “!important“ statement and the property value have a space between them, and display is one of them. So this will resolve the issue:</p><pre>display: none!important</pre><p>Do this for all your properties so you won’t get any more surprises (hopefully).</p><h3><strong>Stay tuned…</strong></h3><p>This concludes part 1 on how to handle the issues that come with coding your own emails. Stay tuned for part 2, where I will give you some more useful tips and tricks!</p><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*1nmvJQfkqYDTkSGtbWpKkw.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://www.ida-mediafoundry.be/nl/jobs.html"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*CmJeDyI92a6wdUXsxr3JqQ.png" /></a></figure><figure><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*HxprJR4afmWbGfoA1-Wh1A.png" /></a></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7532803ead2c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry/pitfalls-of-coding-emails-lessons-learned-part-1-7532803ead2c">Pitfalls of coding emails — lessons learned (part 1)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ida-mediafoundry">ida mediafoundry</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
